An introduction to working with research data

## Get R and R studio

Find the [install instructions here](https://venerable-longma-68a7c8.netlify.app/) and get R and Rstudio installed on your computer.  

## Get a Github account.

Look into the `usethis` package to setup Github in Rstudio

## How to solve coding errors and other technical issues

- Restart and try again
- Check your code for obvious issues - typos, symbols in the wrong place, etc.
- Google it! Include keywords: the language, library, and function you are using, as well as the error message.  
- Read the documentation for the software you are using. 
- Try to reproduce and isolation the issue with a minimal dataset and with as little code as possible.
  - Create a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) of your problem.  
- If you can't solve your issue and it seems rather basic, try posting on social media like reddit or twitter.   
- If it is a more complex issue and the question isn't already solved by what's on StackOverflow, post it there.   
- Include as much information as possible!
- Discuss what you've tried already and what the output was.
