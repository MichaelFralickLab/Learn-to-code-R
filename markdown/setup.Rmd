Dear learner,

Thanks for taking the time to install R and Rstudio ahead of the first
seminar. Installation is super easy and should take \< 10 mins. I
haven't tried to cover any troubleshooting here (there are too many
possibilities)... so **if you run into any issues, please email me for
help!**

If you already have R installed, you *should* update if you are on
version 3.9 or older. There are so many awesome new features in v4.0 and
up. BUT, be forewarned: a new install of R will wipe out all your
existing R libraries and you'll need to install them again (no big deal,
just takes a while to download them all again). Keeping Rstudio updated
is always a good idea and won't affect your R environment!

Best wishes,

## Install R

-   Go to: <https://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/>

-   Click the version for your system (Win, Mac, Linux).
    -   Win page -\> click 'base' version, download on next page.\
    -   Mac page -\> find the version for your processor (intel or arm)
        on the next page, download.
-   Once the installer package finishes downloading, open it.
-   Click 'continue' a bunch of times.
-   Install will complete eventually âœ…
-   You can close and delete the installer package now.

## Install Rstudio IDE

-   Go to: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> and
    scroll down half a page
-   Find "RStudio Desktop - open source license - Free" -\> click
    Download.
-   Next page will show you the version for your OS, click download.
-   Once the installer package finishes downloading, open it.
-   Click 'continue' a bunch of times.
-   Install should complete eventually âœ….
-   You can close and delete the installer package now.

## Verify installation

You should be able to find and open the Rstudio application now. Do so
and find the 'Console' window in the app. Type `R.version` in the
command prompt (after the `>` symbol) and you should see it return the
details like this (with different info for your computer):

## ![](fig/check_version.jpg){width="300"} {style="padding-left: 12rem; padding-right: 6rem;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Install `tidyverse`

Tidyverse is an awesome collection of packages that we will use
constantly. Install it in R by typing this command into the console:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```
